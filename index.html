         <p>The Passover is a day that honors the deliverance of the 12 tribes of Israel from Egypt which is in Africa. 
          The name Passover refers to the blood the Most High required we put upon the two side posts of our doors and passed over our houses when he sent the plague of death upon all the first born. (Exodus 12:12-13, 21-23).
         </p>

         <p>It was during this turbulent time of fear that the Most High proved to Egypt and his chosen people the Israelites that all the Egyptian gods were false idols.
          So come as we honor and remember this day of deliverance with lamb, bitter herbs, and unleaven bread. We give thanks and glory
          to the Most High God.
        </p>

        <h2>Shalom</h2>
